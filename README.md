# DetEdit
A tool to visualize and annotate events from large acoustic datasets. It is highly configurable and can be used for multipurpose ranging from annotation and classification of individual or batches of signals and evaluation of signal properties to removing false detections and obtaining false positive rates.

The tool has been used mainly to process extensive acoustic datasets of odontocete echolocation clicks and human impulsive noise. It can be used to process any stereotyped impulsive signals such as species-specific acoustic signals or calls from fish, crustaceans, bats, birds, insects, etc.
